Hey, I'm Tai ðŸ‘‹
I'm a 21-year-old individual learning to become a developer of sorts, and based in the United Kingdom. I'm very passionate about learning and creating digital experiences.

ðŸ”­  My current aims and ongoing progress:
I'm currently working in the Finance Industry, where my career involves logistical thinking, professional communication, and constant learning. 

And have decided to get into learning how to become a software developer, so here's what I'm currently focused on:

I'm engaged in learning JavaScript as my first fully learned coding language.
I have a basic understanding of Python which I will be aiming to brush up on soon!
I'm a bit of a learner, so significant amount of time learning in my spare time. From 'How is it made?' videos, to 'How does the Hadron Collider work?', I will one day learn it all... even if I do not need to know it.

âœ¨ About Me
I have always loved tech and software, I consider myself an avid gamer... if that helps provide some idea of where that interest comes from. ðŸ˜‚
I am a huge fan of Star Wars, Destiny, Star Citizen, and just anything you can slap a nerdy tag on really haha.
I love everything tech-related, and strangely enjoy building PCs, even building and teaching friends how to construct their own. (For free)
As a kid, I wanted to make games, and while I may not move into that sector, it should be expected that a few personal projects in my life will definitely capture that dream.
