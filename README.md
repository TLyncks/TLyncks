### Hey, I'm Tai ðŸ‘‹
I'm 21 and based in the United Kingdom. ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

### ðŸ”­ My current aims and ongoing progress:
After having previously worked in the Finance Industry, and even achieving a Bachelors Degree in Accounting and Finance, I made the decision that the sector was not where I belonged; hence the reason I am here!

My main goal at the moment is switching careers, and to do this I know I need to lay the foundations so to speak (And there is a lot); So here's what I'm currently focused on:

Right now I am currently studying Masters Course (MSc) in Information and Communication Technology (ICT); this contains modules which cover the following subjects:
 
 - Software Implementation (Utilising C# to develop applications using the .NET Framework)
 - Computer Systems and Servers (Primarily focused on using slackware Linux from the CLI, and launching an Apache Server using PHP)
 - Wed development (As of yet I have not started this module, though I will expect it to focus on languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)
 - Cyber Security

Alongside my formal studies, I am engaged in learning Python, and JavaScript in my spare time. I have a basic understanding of Python already from long ago when I was much younger, but there has been many changes since then! Additionally, through the Summer of 2024, I participated in Harvard's CS50 Courses, in particular CS50P and the first half of CS50X.

And seeing as I am still learning, I am also trying to expand my network to connect with others in the field and learn from their advice and guidance! 

### âœ¨ About Me
Growing up I always loved IT, art, and maths, and even now I love learning and reading! Currently I am reading The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky. 

I am a huge fan of many IPs such as Star Wars, Destiny, Warhammer 40k... I could go on. Really I love pretty much most things nerd-centric it seems. As a kid, I wanted to make games, because admittedly it has always been my core hobby; Though, now I undestand how volative that market can be, I may not move into that sector, but I will definitely dabble in a few personal projects to capture that dream.
