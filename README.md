### Hey, I'm Tai ðŸ‘‹
I'm a 21-year-old learning to become a developer of sorts, and based in the United Kingdom. I'm very passionate about learning and creating digital experiences.

### ðŸ”­ My current aims and ongoing progress:
I'm currently working in the Finance Industry, where my career involves logistical thinking, professional communication, and constant learning. Unfortunately, my passion lies elsewhere, and that is what has brought me here!

My main goal at the moment is switching careers, and to do this I know I need to lay the foundations so to speak (And there is a lot); So here's what I'm currently focused on:

- I'm engaged in learning Python as my first coding language. I have a basic understanding of Python already from long ago when I was much younger, but there has been many changes since then!
- I am participating in Harvard's CS50 Courses, in particular CS50P, with the intention to continue with their broader computer science course CS50x.
- And seeing as I am still learning, I am also trying to expand my network to connect with others in the field and learn from their advice and guidance! 

### âœ¨ About Me
- I love learning new things, and collecting hobbies like they have a pokedex. A significant amount of my spare time is spent learning something new, and I think this space has more than enough to keep me busy!
- I am a huge fan of Star Wars, Destiny, Warhammer 40k... I could go on. Really I love pretty much most things. And, consider myself an avid gamer. ðŸ˜‚
- I always loved IT, art, and maths growing up; and often got involved with activities with elements of logic and design.
- As a kid, I wanted to make games, admittedly it has always been my biggest hobby; And while I may not move into that sector, I will definitely dabble in a few personal projects to capture that dream.
